### This is a small game I made in my freshman year of college called LaurieMOO. 
The language used is Java, with Javafx for the UI.

The game works as follows:
1. You have a a four-digit number randomly generated by the game (or input by the user). 
2. For each digit correctly specified by position, you get a “MOO!” displayed by the program. 
3. For each digit specified that is not in the correct position but is in the solution, a “moo.” is displayed. 
4. If the number is correctly guessed, then in addition to all four “MOO!” strings being displayed you also get a “LaurieMOO!!!” as a reward. 
5. If the user fails to guess the number after ten attempts, the message “Boo hoo -- no LaurieMOO.” is displayed within a message dialog along with the four-digit number (so that the user knows what the answer was).
